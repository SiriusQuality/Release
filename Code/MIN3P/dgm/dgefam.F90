    SUBROUTINE DGEFAM (A,LDA,N,IPVT,INFO)
    
      IMPLICIT NONE
    
      INTEGER LDA,N,IPVT(N),INFO
      DOUBLE PRECISION A(LDA,N)
!C
!C     DGEFAM FACTORS A DOUBLE PRECISION REAL MATRIX BY
!C     GAUSSIAN ELIMINATION.
!C
!C     DGEFAM IS USUALLY CALLED BY DGECOM, BUT IT CAN BE CALLED
!C     DIRECTLY WITH A MODEST SAVING IN TIME IF RCOND IS NOT
!C     NEEDED.
!C
!C     ON ENTRY:
!C
!C        A       DOUBLE PRECISION(LDA,N)
!C                THE MATRIX TO BE FACTORED.
!C
!C        LDA     INTEGER
!C                THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY A AS DECLARED
!C                IN THE MAIN CALLING PROGRAM.
!C
!C        N       INTEGER
!C                THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX A.
!C
!C     ON RETURN:
!C
!C        A       AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX AND THE MULTIPLIERS
!C                WHICH WERE USED TO OBTAIN IT.
!C                THE FACTORIZATION CAN BE WRITTEN  A = L * U WHERE
!C                L IS A PRODUCT OF PERMUTATION AND UNIT LOWER
!C                TRIANGULAR MATRICES AND U IS UPPER TRIANGULAR.
!C
!C        IPVT    INTEGER(N)
!C                AN INTEGER VECTOR OF PIVOT INDICES.
!C                   IPVT(K) = THE INDEX OF THE K-TH PIVOT ROW
!C                THE DETERMINANT OF A CAN BE OBTAINED ON OUTPUT BY
!C                   DET(A) = S*A(1,1)*A(2,2)* ... *A(N,N)
!C                WHERE S = (-1)**(NUMBER OF TIMES IPVT(K) .NE. K)
!C                BUT THIS RESULT SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION AS IT
!C                MAY EASILY UNDERFLOW OR OVERFLOW.
!C
!C        INFO    INTEGER
!C                = 0  NORMAL VALUE.
!C                = K  IF  U(K,K) .EQ. 0.0D0.  THIS IS NOT AN ERROR
!C                     CONDITION FOR THIS SUBROUTINE, BUT IT DOES
!C                     INDICATE THAT DGESLM WILL DIVIDE BY ZERO IF
!C                     CALLED.
!C                     USE RCOND IN DGECOM FOR A RELIABLE INDICATION OF
!C                     SINGULARITY.
!C
!C     THIS VERSION IS ADAPTED FROM THE LINPACK SUBROUTINE DGEFA BY
!C     REPLACEMENT OF CALLS TO THE BLAS WITH IN-LINE CODE.  MODIFICATION
