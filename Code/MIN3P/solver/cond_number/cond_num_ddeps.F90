      SUBROUTINE MC59AD(ICNTL,NC,NR,NE,IRN,LJCN,JCN,LA,A,LIP,IP,  &
                        LIW,IW,INFO)
!C
!C To sort the sparsity pattern of a matrix to an ordering by columns.
!C There is an option for ordering the entries within each column by
!C increasing row indices and an option for checking the user-supplied
!C matrix entries for indices which are out-of-range or duplicated.
!C
!C ICNTL:  INTEGER array of length 10. Intent(IN). Used to specify
!C         control parameters for the subroutine.
!C ICNTL(1): indicates whether the user-supplied matrix entries are to
!C           be checked for duplicates, and out-of-range indices.
!C           Note  simple checks are always performed.
!C           ICNTL(1) = 0, data checking performed.
!C           Otherwise, no data checking.
!C ICNTL(2): indicates the ordering requested.
!C           ICNTL(2) = 0, input is by rows and columns in arbitrary
!C           order and the output is sorted by columns.
!C           ICNTL(2) = 1, the output is also row ordered
!C           within each column.
!C           ICNTL(2) = 2, the input is already ordered by
!C           columns and is to be row ordered within each column.
!C           Values outside the range 0 to 2 are flagged as an error.
!C ICNTL(3): indicates whether matrix entries are also being ordered.
!C           ICNTL(3) = 0, matrix entries are ordered.
!C           Otherwise, only the sparsity pattern is ordered
!C           and the array A is not accessed by the routine.
!C ICNTL(4): the unit number of the device to
!C           which error messages are sent. Error messages
!C           can be suppressed by setting ICNTL(4) < 0.
!C ICNTL(5): the unit number of the device to
!C           which warning messages are sent. Warning
!C           messages can be suppressed by setting ICNTL(5) < 0.
!C ICNTL(6)  indicates whether matrix symmetric. If unsymmetric, ICNTL(6)
!C           must be set to 0.
!C           If ICNTL(6) = -1 or 1, symmetric and only the lower
!C           triangular part of the reordered matrix is returned.
!C           If ICNTL(6) = -2 or 2, Hermitian and only the lower
!C           triangular part of the reordered matrix is returned.
!C           If error checks are performed (ICNTL(1) = 0)
!C           and ICNTL(6)> 1 or 2, the values of duplicate
!C           entries are added together; if ICNTL(6) < -1 or -2, the
!C           value of the first occurrence of the entry is used.
!C ICNTL(7) to ICNTL(10) are not currently accessed by the routine.
!C
!C NC:      INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Must be set by the user
!C          to the number of columns in the matrix.
!C NR:      INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Must be set by the user
!C          to the number of rows in the matrix.
!C NE:      INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Must be set by the user
!C          to the number of entries in the matrix.
!C IRN: INTEGER array of length NE. Intent (INOUT). Must be set by the
!C            user to hold the row indices of the entries in the matrix.
!C          If ICNTL(2).NE.2, the entries may be in any order.
!C          If ICNTL(2).EQ.2, the entries in column J must be in
!C            positions IP(J) to IP(J+1)-1 of IRN. On exit, the row
!C            indices are reordered so that the entries of a single
!C            column are contiguous with column J preceding column J+1, J
!C            = 1, 2, ..., NC-1, with no space between columns.
!C          If ICNTL(2).EQ.0, the order within each column is arbitrary;
!C            if ICNTL(2) = 1 or 2, the order within each column is by
!C            increasing row indices.
!C LJCN:    INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Defines length array
!C JCN:     INTEGER array of length LJCN. Intent (INOUT).
!C          If ICNTL(2) = 0 or 1, JCN(K) must be set by the user
!C          to the column index of the entry
!C          whose row index is held in IRN(K), K = 1, 2, ..., NE.
!C          On exit, the contents of this array  will have been altered.
!C          If ICNTL(2) = 2, the array is not accessed.
!C LA:      INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Defines length of array
!C          A.
!C A:       is a REAL (DOUBLE PRECISION in the D version, INTEGER in
!C          the I version, COMPLEX in the C version,
!C          or COMPLEX"*"16 in the Z version) array of length LA.
!C          Intent(INOUT).
!C          If ICNTL(3).EQ.0, A(K) must be set by the user to
!C          hold the value of the entry with row index IRN(K),
!C          K = 1, 2, ..., NE. On exit, the array will have been
!C          permuted in the same way as the array IRN.
!C          If ICNTL(3).NE.0, the array is not accessed.
!C LIP:     INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Defines length of array
!C          IP.
!C IP:      INTEGER array of length LIP. Intent(INOUT). IP
!C          need only be set by the user if ICNTL(2) = 2.
!C          In this case, IP(J) holds the position in
!C          the array IRN of the first entry in column J, J = 1, 2,
!C          ..., NC, and IP(NC+1) is one greater than the number of
!C          entries in the matrix.
!C          In all cases, the array IP will have this meaning on exit
!C          from the subroutine and is altered when ICNTL(2) = 2 only
!C          when ICNTL(1) =  0 and there are out-of-range
!C          indices or duplicates.
!C LIW:     INTEGER variable. Intent(IN). Defines length of array
!C          IW.
!C IW:      INTEGER array of length LIW. Intent(OUT). Used by the
!C          routine as workspace.
!C INFO:    INTEGER array of length 10.  Intent(OUT). On exit,
!C          a negative value of INFO(1) is used to signal a fatal
!C          error in the input data, a positive value of INFO(1)
!C          indicates that a warning has been issued, and a
!C          zero value is used to indicate a successful call.
!C          In cases of error, further information is held in INFO(2).
!C          For warnings, further information is
!C          provided in INFO(3) to INFO(6).  INFO(7) to INFO(10) are not
!C          currently used and are set to zero.
!C          Possible nonzero values of INFO(1):
!C         -1 -  The restriction ICNTL(2) = 0, 1, or 2 violated.
!C               Value of ICNTL(2) is given by INFO(2).
!C         -2 -  NC.LE.0. Value of NC is given by INFO(2).
!C         -3 -  Error in NR. Value of NR is given by INFO(2).
!C         -4 -  NE.LE.0. Value of NE is given by INFO(2).
!C         -5 -  LJCN too small. Min. value of LJCN is given by INFO(2).
!C         -6 -  LA too small. Min. value of LA is given by INFO(2).
!C         -7 -  LIW too small. Value of LIW is given by INFO(2).
!C         -8 -  LIP too small. Value of LIP is given by INFO(2).
!C         -9 -  The entries of IP not monotonic increasing.
!C        -10 -  For each I, IRN(I) or JCN(I) out-of-range.
!C        -11 -  ICNTL(6) is out of range.
!C         +1 -  One or more duplicated entries. One copy of
!C               each such entry is kept and, if ICNTL(3) = 0 and
!C               ICNTL(6).GE.0, the values of these entries are
!C               added together. If  ICNTL(3) = 0 and ICNTL(6).LT.0,
!C               the value of the first occurrence of the entry is used.
!C               Initially INFO(3) is set to zero. If an entry appears
!C               k times, INFO(3) is incremented by k-1 and INFO(6)
!C               is set to the revised number of entries in the
!C               matrix.
!C         +2 - One or more of the entries in IRN out-of-range. These
!C               entries are removed by the routine.`INFO(4) is set to
!C               the number of entries which were out-of-range and
!C               INFO(6) is set to the revised number of entries in the
!C               matrix.
!C         +4 - One or more of the entries in JCN out-of-range. These
!C               entries are removed by the routine. INFO(5) is set to
!C               the number of entries which were out-of-range and
!C               INFO(6) is set to the revised number of entries in the
!C               matrix. Positive values of INFO(1) are summed so that
!C               the user can identify all warnings.

!C IRN  is an integer array.  Entries 1 to NE must be set to the
!C      row indices of the corresponding entries in A.  IRN is used
!C      as workspace and holds the row indices of the reduced matrix.
!C JCN  is an integer array that need not be set by the user. It is
!C      used to hold the column indices of entries in the reduced
!C      matrix.
!C IQ is an integer array of length N. On entry, it holds pointers

!C      the start of column j of the reduced matrix or -IQ(j) holds the

!C     CNTL(1)  Full matrix processing will be used if the density of

!C     CNTL(2) determines the balance between pivoting for sparsity and
!C       for stability, values near zero emphasizing sparsity and values
!C       near one emphasizing stability. Each pivot must have absolute
!C       value at least CNTL(2) times the greatest absolute value in the
!C       same column of the reduced matrix.
!C     CNTL(3) If this is set to a positive value, any entry of the
!C       reduced matrix whose modulus is less than CNTL(3) will be
!C       dropped.
!C     CNTL(4)  Any entry of the reduced matrix whose modulus is less
!C       than or equal to CNTL(4) will be regarded as zero from the
!C        point of view of rank.
!C ICNTL must be set by the user as follows and is not altered.
!C     ICNTL(1)  must be set to the stream number for error messages.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(2) must be set to the stream number for diagnostic output.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(3) must be set to control the amount of output:
!C       0 None.

!C       2 Error and warning messages.
!C       3 As 2, plus scalar parameters and a few entries of array
!C         parameters on entry and exit.
!C       4 As 3, plus all parameters on entry and exit.
!C     ICNTL(4) If set to a positive value, the pivot search is limited
!C       to ICNTL(4) columns (Zlatev strategy). This may result in
!C       different fill-in and execution time. If ICNTL(4) is positive,
!C       the workspace arrays LASTR and NEXTR are not referenced.
!C     ICNTL(5) The block size to be used for full-matrix processing.
!C     ICNTL(6) The last ICNTL(6) columns of A must be the last
!C       ICNTL(6) columns of the permuted matrix. A value outside the
!C       range 1 to N-1 is treated as zero.
!C     ICNTL(7) If given the value 1, pivots are limited to
!C       the main diagonal, which may lead to a premature switch to full
!C       processing if no suitable diagonal entries are available.
!C       If given the value 2, IFIRST must be set so that IFIRST(i) is
!C       the column in position i of the permuted matrix and IP must
!C       be set so that IP(i) < IP(j) if row i is recommended to
!C       precede row j in the pivot sequence.
!C IP is an integer array of length M that need not be set on entry
!C      unless ICNTL(7)=2 (see ICNTL(7) for details of this case).
!C      During execution, IP(i) holds the position of the start of row i
!C      of the reduced matrix or -IP(i) holds the row index in the
!C      permuted matrix of row i. Before exit, IP(i) is made positive.
!C NP is an integer variable. It need not be set on entry. On exit,
!C     it will be set to the number of columns to be processed in
!C     packed storage.
!C JFIRST is an integer workarray of length M. JFIRST(i) is the
!C      first column of the reduced matrix to have i entries or is
!C      zero if no column has i entries.
!C LENR is an integer workarray of length M that is used to hold the
!C      numbers of entries in the rows of the reduced matrix.
!C LASTR is an integer workarray of length M, used only if ICNTL(4) = 0.
!C      For rows in the reduced matrix, LASTR(i) indicates the previous
!C      row to i with the same number of entries. LASTR(i) is zero if
!C      no such row exists.
!C NEXTR is an integer workarray of length M, used only if ICNTL(4) = 0
!C      or ICNTL(7)=2. If ICNTL(4)=0, for rows in the reduced matrix,
!C      NEXTR(i) indicates the next row to i with the same number of
!C      entries; and if row i is the last in the chain, NEXTR is
!C      equal to zero. If ICNTL(7)=2, NEXTR is a copy of the value of
!C      IP on entry.
!C IW is an integer array of length M used as workspace and is used to
!C     assist the detection of duplicate entries and the sparse SAXPY
!C     operations. It is reset to zero each time round the main loop.
!C IFIRST is an integer array of length N, used only if ICNTL(4) = 0
!C      or ICNTL(7)=2. If ICNTL(4) = 0, it is a workarray; IFIRST(i)
!C      points to the first row of the reduced matrix to have i entries
!C      or is zero if no row has i entries. If ICNTL(7)=2, IFIRST
!C      must be set on entry (see ICNTL(7) for details of this case).
!C LENC is an integer workarray of length N that is used to hold
!C      the numbers of entries in the columns of the reduced matrix.
!C LASTC is an integer workarray of length N.  For columns in the reduced
!C      matrix, LASTC(j) indicates the previous column to j with the same
!C      number of entries.  If column j is the first in the chain,
!C      LASTC(j) is equal to zero.
!C NEXTC is an integer workarray of length N.  For columns in the reduced
!C      matrix, NEXTC(j) indicates the next column to j with the same
!C      number of entries.  If column j is the last column in the chain,
!C      NEXTC(j) is zero.
!C INFO need not be set on entry. On exit, it holds the following:
!C    INFO(1):
!C       0  Successful entry.
!C      -1  M < 1 or N < 1.
!C      -2  NE < 1.
!C      -3  Insufficient space.
!C      -4  Duplicated entries.
!C      -5  Faulty column permutation in IFIRST when ICNTL(7)=2.
!C      -6  ICNTL(4) not equal to 1 when ICNTL(7)=2.
!C      +1  Rank deficient.
!C      +2  Premature switch to full processing because of failure to
!C          find a stable diagonal pivot (ICNTL(7)>=1 case only).
!C      +3  Both of these warnings.
!C    INFO(2) Number of compresses of the arrays.
!C    INFO(3) Minimum LA recommended to analyse matrix.
!C    INFO(4) Minimum LFACT required to factorize matrix.
!C    INFO(5) Upper bound on the rank of the matrix.
!C    INFO(6) Number of entries dropped from the data structure.
!C    INFO(7) Number of rows processed in full storage.
!C RINFO need not be set on entry. On exit, RINFO(1) holds the number of
!C    floating-point operations needed for the factorization.

!C M is an integer variable that must be set to the number of rows.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C N is an integer variable that must be set to the number of columns.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C NE is an integer variable that must be set to the number of entries
!C      in the input matrix.  It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C JOB is an integer variable that must be set to the value 1, 2, or 3.
!C     If JOB is equal to 1 and any of the first NP recommended pivots
!C      fails to satisfy the threshold pivot tolerance, the row is
!C      interchanged with the earliest row in the recommended sequence
!C      that does satisfy the tolerance. Normal row interchanges are
!C      performed in the last N-NP columns.
!C     If JOB is equal to 2, then M, N, NE, IRNA, IPTRA, IP, IQ,
!C      LFACT, NP, IRNF, IPTRL, and IPTRU must be unchanged since a
!C      JOB=1 entry for the same matrix pattern and no interchanges are
!C      performed among the first NP pivots; if ICNTL(6) > 0, the first
!C      N-ICNTL(6) columns of AA must also be unchanged.
!C     If JOB is equal to 3, ICNTL(6) must be in the range 1 to N-1.
!C      The effect is as for JOB=2 except that interchanges are
!C      performed.
!C     JOB is not altered by the subroutine.
!C AA is an array that holds the entries of the matrix and
!C      is not altered.
!C IRNA is an integer array of length NE that must be set to hold the
!C      row indices of the corresponding entries in AA. It is not
!C      altered.
!C IPTRA is an integer array that holds the positions of the starts of
!C      the columns of AA. It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C CNTL  must be set by the user as follows and is not altered.
!C     CNTL(2) determines the balance between pivoting for sparsity and
!C       for stability, values near zero emphasizing sparsity and values
!C       near one emphasizing stability.
!C     CNTL(3) If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(3) will be dropped from the factors.
!C       The factorization will then require less storage but will be
!C       inaccurate.
!C     CNTL(4)  Any entry of the reduced matrix whose modulus is less
!C       than or equal to CNTL(4) will be regarded as zero from the
!C        point of view of rank.
!C ICNTL must be set by the user as follows and is not altered.
!C     ICNTL(1)  must be set to the stream number for error messages.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(2) must be set to the stream number for diagnostic output.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(3) must be set to control the amount of output:
!C       0 None.
!C       1 Error messages only.
!C       2 Error and warning messages.
!C       3 As 2, plus scalar parameters and a few entries of array
!C         parameters on entry and exit.
!C       4 As 2, plus all parameters on entry and exit.
!C     ICNTL(5) The block size to be used for full-matrix processing.
!C       If <=0, the BLAS1 version is used.
!C       If =1, the BLAS2 version is used.
!C     ICNTL(6) If N > ICNTL(6) > 0, only the columns of A that
!C       correspond to the last ICNTL(6) columns of the permuted matrix
!C       may change prior to an entry with JOB > 1.
!C     ICNTL(8) If this has value 1, there is no attempt to compute a
!C       recommended value for LFACT if it is too small.
!C IP is an integer array. If JOB=1, it must be set so that IP(I) < IP(J)
!C      if row I is recommended to precede row J in the pivot sequence.
!C      If JOB>1, it need not be set. If JOB=1 or JOB=3, IP(I) is set
!C      to -K when row I is chosen for pivot K and IP is eventually
!C      reset to recommend the chosen pivot sequence to a subsequent
!C      JOB=1 entry. If JOB=2, IP is not be referenced.
!C IQ is an integer array that must be set so that either IQ(J) is the
!C      column in position J in the pivot sequence, J=1,2,...,N,
!C      or IQ(1)=0 and the columns are taken in natural order.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C NP is an integer variable that holds the number of columns to be
!C      processed in packed storage. It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C LFACT is an integer variable set to the size of FACT and IRNF.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C FACT is an array that need not be set on a JOB=1 entry and must be
!C      unchanged since the previous entry if JOB>1. On return, FACT(1)
!C      holds the value of CNTL(3) used, FACT(2) will holds the value
!C      of CNTL(4) used, FACT(3:IPTRL(N)) holds the packed part of L/U
!C      by columns, and the full part of L/U is held by columns
!C      immediately afterwards. U has unit diagonal entries, which are
!C      not stored. In each column of the packed part, the entries of
!C      U precede the entries of L; also the diagonal entries of L
!C      head each column of L and are reciprocated.
!C IRNF is an integer array of length LFACT that need not be set on
!C      a JOB=1 entry and must be unchanged since the previous entry
!C      if JOB>1. On exit, IRNF(1) holds the number of dropped entries,
!C      IRNF(2) holds the number of rows MF in full storage,
!C      IRNF(3:IPTRL(N)) holds the row numbers of the packed part
!C      of L/U, IRNF(IPTRL(N)+1:IPTRL(N)+MF) holds the row indices
!C      of the full part of L/U, and IRNF(IPTRL(N)+MF+I), I=1,2,..,N-NP
!C      holds the vector IPIV output by MA50GD.
!C      If JOB=2, IRNF will be unaltered.
!C IPTRL is an integer array that need not be set on a JOB=1 entry and
!C     must be unchanged since the previous entry if JOB>1.
!C     For J = 1,..., NP, IPTRL(J) holds the position in
!C     FACT and IRNF of the end of column J of L.
!C     For J = NP+1,..., N, IPTRL(J) is equal to IPTRU(J).
!C IPTRU is an integer array that need not be set on a JOB=1 entry and
!C     must be unchanged since the previous entry if JOB>1.
!C     For J = 1,..., N, IPTRU(J) holds the position in
!C     FACT and IRNF of the end of the packed part of column J of U.
!C W is an array of length M used as workspace for holding
!C      the expanded form of a sparse vector.
!C IW is an integer array of length M+2*N used as workspace.
!C INFO need not be set on entry. On exit, it holds the following:
!C    INFO(1) A negative value will indicate an error return and a
!C       positive value a warning. Possible nonzero values are:
!C      -1  M < 1 or N < 1.
!C      -2  NE < 0.
!C      -3  Insufficient space.
!C      -4  There are duplicated entries.
!C      -5  JOB < 1, 3 when ICNTL(6)=0, or > 3.
!C      -6  JOB = 2, but entries were dropped in the corresponding JOB=1
!C          entry.
!C      -7  NP < 0 or NP > N.
!C     -(7+K) Pivot too small in column K when JOB=2.
!C      +1  Rank deficient.
!C    INFO(4) Minimum storage required to factorize matrix
!C            if INFO(1) >= 0. Recommended value for LFACT
!C            if ICNTL(8) = 0 and INFO(1) = -3.
!C    INFO(5) Computed rank of the matrix.
!C    INFO(6) Number of entries dropped from the data structure.
!C    INFO(7) Number of rows processed in full storage.
!C RINFO need not be set on entry. On exit, RINFO(1) holds the number of
!C    floating-point operations performed.

!*
!*  Purpose
!*  =======
!*
!*  MA50GD computes an LU factorization of a general m-by-n matrix A.
!*
!*  The factorization has the form
!*     A = P * L * U * Q
!*  where P is a permutation matrix of order m, L is lower triangular
!*  of order m with unit diagonal elements, U is upper trapezoidal of
!*  order m * n, and Q is a permutation matrix of order n.
!*
!*  Row interchanges are used to ensure that the entries of L do not
!*  exceed 1 in absolute value. Column interchanges are used to
!*  ensure that the first r diagonal entries of U exceed PIVTOL in
!*  absolute value. If r < m, the last (m-r) rows of U are zero.
!*
!*  This is the Level 3 BLAS version.
!*
!*  Arguments
!*  =========
!*
!*  M       (input) INTEGER
!*          The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 1.
!*
!*  N       (input) INTEGER
!*          The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 1.
!*
!*  A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
!*          On entry, the m by n matrix to be factored.
!*          On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
!*          A = P*L*U*Q; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
!*
!*  LDA     (input) INTEGER
!*          The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
!*
!*  NB      (input) INTEGER
!*          The block size for BLAS3 processing.
!*
!*  PIVTOL  (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
!*          The pivot tolerance. Any entry with absolute value less
!*          than or equal to PIVTOL is regarded as unsuitable to be a
!*          pivot.
!**
!*  IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
!*          The permutations; for 1 <= i <= RANK, row i of the
!*          matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i); for
!*          RANK + 1 <= j <= N, column j of the
!*          matrix was interchanged with column -IPIV(j).
!*
!*  RANK    (output) INTEGER
!*          The computed rank of the matrix.

!C
!C M must be set by the user to the number of rows.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.  Restriction:  M > 0.
!C N must be set by the user to the number of columns.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.  Restriction:  N > 0.
!C NE must be set by the user to the number of entries in the input
!C      matrix. It is not altered by the subroutine. Restriction: NE > 0.
!C JOB must be set by the user to 1 for automatic choice of pivots and
!C      to 2 if the pivot sequence is specified in KEEP.  If JOB is set
!C      to 3, then pivots are chosen automatically from the diagonal as
!C      long as this is numerically feasible.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine.  Restriction: 1 <= JOB <= 3.
!C LA must be set by the user to the size of A, IRN, and JCN.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine. Restriction LA >= 2*NE.
!C      Normally a value of 3*NE will suffice.
!C A must have its first NE elements set by the user to hold the matrix
!C      entries. They may be in any order. If there is more than one for
!C      a particular matrix position, they are accumulated. The first
!C      NE entries are not altered by the subroutine. The rest is used
!C      as workspace for the active submatrix.
!C IRN  is an integer array. Entries 1 to NE must be set to the
!C      row indices of the corresponding entries in A.  On return, the
!C      leading part holds the row numbers of the permuted matrix, with
!C      duplicates excluded. The permuted matrix is block upper
!C      triangular with recommended pivots on its diagonal. The entries
!C      of the block diagonal part are held contiguously from IRN(1)
!C      and the entries of the off-diagonal part are held contiguously
!C      backwards from IRN(NE) during the computation.  At the end the
!C      off-diagonal blocks are held contiguously immediately after the
!C      diagonal blocks.
!C JCN  is an integer array. Entries 1 to NE must be set to the column
!C      indices of the corresponding entries in A. On return, JCN(k)
!C      holds the position in IRN that corresponds to the entry that was
!C      input in A(k), k=1,NE.  Entries corresponding to out-of-range
!C      indices are first set to 0 then, before exit, to NE+1.
!C      If duplicates are found, the first entry of JCN is negated.
!C KEEP is an integer array that need not be set on a JOB=1 or JOB=3
!C      entry. On entry with JOB=2 and always
!C      on a successful exit, KEEP(i) holds the position of row i in the
!C      permuted matrix, I=1,M and KEEP(M+j) holds the index of the
!C      column that is in position j of the permuted matrix, j=1,N.
!C      The rest of the array need not be set on entry. On exit:
!C        KEEP(IPTRD+j), IPTRD=M+3*N, holds the position in IRN of the
!C          start of the block diagonal part of column j, J=1,N;
!C        KEEP(IPTRD+N+1) holds the position that immediately follows
!C          the end of the block diagonal part of column N;
!C        KEEP(IPTRO+j),IPTRO=IPTRD+N+1, holds the position in IRN of
!C          the start of the block off-diagonal part of column j, j=1,N;
!C        KEEP(IPTRO+N+1) holds the position that immediately
!C          follows the end of the block off-diagonal part of column N;
!C          During the computation, the columns of the off-diagonal
!C          blocks are held in reverse order and KEEP(IPTRO+N+1) points
!C          to the position immediately before the off-diagonal block
!C          storage.
!C        KEEP(KBLOCK+3), KBLOCK=IPTRO+N+1, holds the number of
!C          blocks NB in the block triangular form;
!C        KEEP(NBLOCK+3*k), NBLOCK=IPTRO+N-1, holds the number of columns
!C          in block k, k=1,NB; and
!C        KEEP(MBLOCK+3*k), MBLOCK=IPTRO+N, is negative if block k
!C          is triangular or holds the number of rows held in packed
!C          storage when processing block k, k=1,NB.
!C        KEEP(LBLOCK+k), LBLOCK=KBLOCK+3*NB is accessed only if ICNTL(8)
!C          is not equal to 0 and will be set to the number of columns
!C          in block k which are to be pivoted on last, k=1,NB.
!C CNTL  is a real array of length 10 that must be set by the user
!C       as follows and is not altered.
!C     CNTL(1)  If this is set to a value less than or equal to one, full
!C       matrix processing will be used by MA50A/AD when the density of
!C       the reduced matrix reaches CNTL(1).
!C     CNTL(2) determines the balance used by MA50A/AD and MA50B/BD
!C       between pivoting for sparsity and for stability, values near
!C       zero emphasizing sparsity and values near one emphasizing
!C       stability.
!C     CNTL(3) If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(3) will be dropped from the factors
!C       calculated by MA50A/AD. The factorization will then require
!C       less storage but will be inaccurate.
!C     CNTL(4)  If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(4) will be regarded as zero from
!C       the point of view of rank.
!C     CNTL(5:10) are not accessed by this subroutine.
!C ICNTL is an integer array of length 20 that must be set by the user
!C       as follows and is not altered.
!C     ICNTL(1)  must be set to the stream number for error messages.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(2) must be set to the stream number for diagnostic output.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(3) must be set to control the amount of output:
!C       0 None.
!C       1 Error messages only.
!C       2 Error and warning messages.
!C       3 As 2, plus scalar parameters and a few entries of array
!C         parameters on entry and exit.
!C       4 As 2, plus all parameters on entry and exit.
!C     ICNTL(4)  If set to a positive value, the pivot search by MA50A/AD
!C       is limited to ICNTL(4) columns. This may result in different
!C       fill-in and execution time but could give faster execution.
!C     ICNTL(5) The block size to be used for full-matrix processing.
!C     ICNTL(6) is the minimum size for a block of the block triangular
!C       form.
!C     ICNTL(7) If not equal to 0, abort when structurally rank deficient
!C       matrix found.
!C     ICNTL(8) If set to a value other than zero and JOB = 1 or 3,
!C       columns with IW flagged 0 are placed at
!C       the end of their respective blocks in the first factorization
!C       and the remaining columns are assumed unchanged in subsequent
!C       factorizations. If set to a value other than zero and JOB = 2,
!C       columns before the first 0 entry of IW are assumed unchanged in
!C       subsequent factorizations.
!C     ICNTL(9:20) are not accessed by this subroutine.
!C IW   is an integer array of length 6*M+3*N that is used as workspace.
!C      If ICNTL(8) is not 0, the first N entries of IW must be set on
!C      entry so that IW(i), i=1,N is zero for and only for the columns
!C      designated to be at the end of the pivot sequence. Since IW is
!C      used as workspace, this will be destroyed by the subroutine.
!C INFO is an integer array of length 20 that need not be set on entry.
!C   INFO(1)  On exit, a negative value  will indicate an error return
!C      and a positive value will indicate a warning.
!C      Possible nonzero values are:
!C      -1  M < 1 or N < 1
!C      -2  NE < 1
!C      -3  Insufficient space
!C      -4  ICNTL(7) not equal to 0 and the matrix is structurally rank
!C          deficient.
!C      -5  Faulty permutation input on JOB = 2 entry
!C      -6  JOB out of range
!C      +1  Row or column number out of range (such entries are ignored)
!C          and/or more than one entry for the same matrix position.
!C      +2  Matrix rank deficient.  Estimated rank in INFO(5).
!C          more than one entry for the same matrix position
!C      +3  Combination of warnings +1 and +2.
!C      +4  Premature switch to full code because of problems in choosing
!C          diagonal pivots (JOB = 3 entry).
!C      +5  Combination of warnings +1 and +4.
!C      +6  Combination of warnings +2 and +4.
!C      +7  Combination of warnings +1, +2 and +4.
!C    INFO(2) Number of compresses of the files.
!C    INFO(3) Minimum storage required to analyse matrix.
!C    INFO(4) Minimum storage required to factorize matrix.
!C    INFO(5) Upper bound on the rank of the matrix.
!C    INFO(6) Number of entries dropped from the data structure.
!C    INFO(7) Order of the largest nontriangular block on the diagonal
!C            of the block triangular form.
!C    INFO(8) Total of the orders of all the nontriangular blocks on the
!C            diagonal of the block triangular form.
!C    INFO(9) Total no. of entries in all the nontriangular blocks on
!C            the diagonal of the block triangular form.
!C    INFO(10) Structural rank.
!C    INFO(11) Number of multiple entries in the input data.
!C    INFO(12) Number of entries with out-of-range indices.

!C      It is not altered by the subroutine. Restriction: N > 0.
!C NE must be set by the user to the number of entries in the input
!C      matrix. It is not altered by the subroutine. Restriction: NE > 0.

!C LA must be set by the user to the size of A and IRN.
!C      It is not altered by the subroutine. Restriction: LA > 2*NE.
!C A    must be set by the user so that the first NE elements hold the
!C      matrix entries in exactly the same order as were input to
!C      MA48A/AD. On return, these elements hold the permuted matrix A
!C      and the rest contains the factorizations of the block diagonal
!C      part (excluding blocks that are triangular).
!C IRN  The first KEEP(IPTRO+N+1)-1 (<=NE) entries must be as on return
!C      from MA48A/AD and hold
!C      the row numbers of the permuted matrix, with duplicates excluded.
!C      The permuted matrix is block upper triangular with recommended

!C      entry with JOB=1. It is used for the row indices of the

!C      since the entry with JOB=1 and is not altered.
!C JCN  must be as on return from MA48A/AD. abs(JCN(k)) holds the
!C      position in IRN that corresponds to the entry that was input in
!C      A(k),k=1,NE.  It is not altered by the subroutine.
!C      If JCN(1) is negative then there are duplicates.
!C KEEP must be as on return from MA48A/AD or MA48B/BD.
!C      KEEP(i) holds the position of row i in the permuted
!C        matrix, I=1,M;
!C      KEEP(N+j) holds the index of the  column that is in position j
!C        of the permuted matrix, j=1,N;

!C        of the block, to the columns of the
!C        lower-triangular part of the factorization. On entry with
!C        JOB=2, it must be unchanged since the entry with JOB=1 and is
!C        not altered.
!C      KEEP(IPTRU+k), IPTRU=IPTRL+N, k=1,N, need not be set on an
!C        entry with JOB=1. It holds pointers, relative to the start
!C        of the block, to the columns of the

!C        JOB=2, it must be unchanged since the entry with JOB=1 and
!C        is not altered.
!C      KEEP(IPTRD+j), IPTRD=IPTRU+N, holds the position in IRN of the
!C        start of the block diagonal part of column j, J=1,N;
!C      KEEP(IPTRD+N+1) holds the position that immediately follows

!C      KEEP(MBLOCK+3*k), MBLOCK=IPTRO+N, is negative if block k
!C        is triangular or holds the number of rows held in packed
!C        storage when processing block k, k=1,NB;
!C      KEEP(KBLOCK+3*k), k=2,NB need not be set on an entry with
!C        JOB=1; on return it holds zero for a triangular block and for
!C        a non-triangular block holds the position in A(NEWNE+1) and
!C        IRN(NEWNE+1) of the start of the factorization of the block.
!C        KEEP(LBLOCK+k), LBLOCK=KBLOCK+3*NB is accessed only if ICNTL(8)
!C          is not 0 and holds the number of columns in
!C          block k which are to be pivoted on last, k=1,NB.
!C      On an entry with JOB=2, KEEP must be unchanged since the entry
!C      with JOB=1 and is not altered.
!C CNTL  must be set by the user as follows and is not altered.
!C     CNTL(2) determines the balance used by MA50A/AD and MA50B/BD
!C       between pivoting for sparsity and for stability, values near
!C       zero emphasizing sparsity and values near one emphasizing
!C       stability.
!C     CNTL(3) If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(3) will be dropped from the factors
!C       calculated by MA50A/AD. The factorization will then require
!C       less storage but will be inaccurate.
!C     CNTL(4)  If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(4) will be regarded as zero from
!C       the point of view of rank.
!C     CNTL(5:10) are not referenced by the subroutine.
!C ICNTL must be set by the user as follows and is not altered.
!C     ICNTL(1)  must be set to the stream number for error messages.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(2) must be set to the stream number for diagnostic output.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(3) must be set to control the amount of output:
!C       0 None.
!C       1 Error messages only.
!C       2 Error and warning messages.
!C       3 As 2, plus scalar parameters and a few entries of array
!C         parameters on entry and exit.
!C       4 As 2, plus all parameters on entry and exit.
!C     ICNTL(4)  If set to a positive value, the pivot search by MA50A/AD
!C       is limited to ICNTL(4) columns. This may result in different
!C       fill-in and execution time.
!C     ICNTL(5) The block size to be used for full-matrix processing.
!C     ICNTL(6) is not referenced by the subroutine.
!C     ICNTL(8) If set to a value other than zero and JOB = 2 or 3,
!C       it is assumed that only the last KEEP(LBLOCK+JB), JB = 1,NB
!C       columns have changed since the last factorization.
!C     ICNTL(9) is not referenced by the subroutine.
!C     ICNTL(10) has default value 0. If set to 1, there is an immediate
!C       return from MA48B/BD if LA is too small, without continuing the
!C       decomposition to compute the size necessary.
!C     ICNTL(11) has default value 0. If set to 1 on a JOB=2 call to
!C       MA48B/BD and the entries in one of the blocks on the diagonal
!C       are unsuitable for the pivot sequence chosen on the previous
!C       call, the block is refactorized as on a JOB=1 call.
!C     ICNTL(12:20) are not referenced by the subroutine.
!
!C W    is a workarray.
!C IW   is a workarray.
!C INFO(1) is an integer variable that need not be set on entry. On exit,
!C      a nonzero value of INFO(1) will indicate an error return.
!C      Possible nonzero values are:
!C      -1  M < 1 or N < 1
!C      -2  NE < 0
!C      -3  Insufficient space
!C      -6  JOB out of range or JOB = 2 or 3 after factorization in which
!C          entries were dropped.
!C      -7  On a call with JOB=2, the matrix entries are numerically
!C          unsuitable
!C      +2  Matrix is structurally rank deficient. Estimated rank in
!C          INFO(5).
!C INFO(4) is set to the minimum size required for a further
!C      factorization on a matrix with the same pivot sequence.
!C INFO(5) is set to computed rank of the matrix.
!C INFO(6) is set to number of entries dropped from structure.
!C RINFO need not be set on entry. On exit, RINFO(1) holds the number of
!C    floating-point operations performed.

!C CNTL  is a real array of length 10.
!C     CNTL(1)  If this is set to a value less than or equal to one, full
!C       matrix processing will be used by MA50A/AD  when the density of
!C       the reduced matrix reaches CNTL(1).
!C     CNTL(2) determines the balance used by MA50A/AD and MA50B/BD
!C       between pivoting for sparsity and for stability, values near
!C       zero emphasizing sparsity and values near one emphasizing
!C       stability.
!C     CNTL(3) If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(3) will be dropped from the factors
!C       calculated by MA50A/AD. The factorization will then require
!C       less storage but will be inaccurate.
!C     CNTL(4)  If this is set to a positive value, any entry whose
!C       modulus is less than CNTL(4) will be regarded as zero from
!C       the point of view of rank.
!C     CNTL(5) is used in convergence test for termination of iterative
!C       refinement.  Iteration stops if successive omegas do not
!C       decrease by at least this factor.
!C     CNTL(6:10) are not used.
!C ICNTL is an integer array of length 20.
!C     ICNTL(1)  must be set to the stream number for error messages.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(2) must be set to the stream number for diagnostic output.
!C       A value less than 1 suppresses output.
!C     ICNTL(3) must be set to control the amount of output:
!C       0 None.
!C       1 Error messages only.
!C       2 Error and warning messages.
!C       3 As 2, plus scalar parameters and a few entries of array
!C         parameters on entry and exit.
!C       4 As 2, plus all parameters on entry and exit.
!C     ICNTL(4)  If set to a positive value, the pivot search by MA50A/AD
!C       is limited to ICNTL(4) columns. This may result in different
!C       fill-in and execution time but could give faster execution.
!C     ICNTL(5) The block size to be used for full-matrix processing.
!C     ICNTL(6) is the minimum size for a block of the block triangular
!C       form.
!C     ICNTL(7) If not equal to 0, abort when structurally rank deficient
!C       matrix found.
!C     ICNTL(8) If set to a value other than zero and JOB = 1 or 3 on
!C       entry to MA48A/AD, columns with IW flagged 0 are placed at
!C       the end of their respective blocks in the first factorization
!C       and the remaining columns are assumed unchanged in subsequent
!C       factorizations. If set to a value other than zero and JOB = 2,
!C       columns before the first 0 entry of IW are assumed unchanged in
!C       subsequent factorizations.  On entry to MA48B/BD, the number
!C       of columns that can change in each block is held in array KEEP.
!C     ICNTL(9) is the limit on the number of iterative refinements
!C        allowed by MA48C/CD
!C     ICNTL(10) has default value 0. If set to 1, there is an immediate
!C       return from MA48B/BD if LA is too small, without continuing the
!C       decomposition to compute the size necessary.
!C     ICNTL(11) has default value 0. If set to 1 on a JOB=2 call to
!C       MA48B/BD and the entries in one of the blocks on the diagonal
!C       are unsuitable for the pivot sequence chosen on the previous
!C       call, the block is refactorized as on a JOB=1 call.
!C     ICNTL(12:20) are not used.
